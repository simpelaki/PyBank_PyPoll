PyBank Challenge - Tasked with creating a python script to analyze the financial records using the budget_data.csv file. The python script analyzed the records to calculate -

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The script printed the analysis to the terminal and also exported a text file with the results to the 'analysis' folder.
